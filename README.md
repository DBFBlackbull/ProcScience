## ProcScience from Classic WoW Armaments

This addon is a direct copy from the Classic WoW Armaments Discord server: https://discord.gg/NKjS5KKk.
This is not the official github repository of this addon. No official repository seems exists.

I do not own the discord server, the addon or is affiliated with either in any way.

## Functionality

The addon tries to calculate the proc rates of various items and weapons in Classic WoW.
It only tracks a handful of items, and any specific items needs to be added by the user manually.
