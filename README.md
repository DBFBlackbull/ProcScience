# Work in Progress

This is a work in progress, trying to backport the ProcScience addon from 1.14 Classic to 1.12.1 Vanilla.

For the 1.14 version check the 'classic' branch. 

## ProcScience from Classic WoW Armaments

This addon is a direct copy from the Classic WoW Armaments Discord server: https://discord.gg/NKjS5KKk.
This is not the official github repository of this addon. No official repository seems exists.

I do not own the discord server, the addon or is affiliated with either in any way.

## Functionality

The addon tries to calculate the proc rates of various items and weapons in Classic WoW.
It only tracks a handful of items, and any specific items needs to be added by the user manually.
